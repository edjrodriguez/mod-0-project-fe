## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

I am extremely comfortable asking questions.  As an educator, I know how important it is to know when you don't know and I have no shame in admitting I don't understand/need clarification.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

The 3 types I learned about are String, number, and boolean.  
I honestly think about these as the 3 types of answers to a math test.

String is like your written response questions.  Strings go in quotes and will print in the log exactly as you typed it in the quotation marks.  The values you put in strings can be anything (numbers, characters, words, etc.)

Numbers are like the problems on a math test that just require a number answer.  these do not need to be in quotes and just represent a number value.  decimals, whole numbers, and negative numbers are examples.

Boolean is like a true false question on a math test.  "does the x value satisfy the inequality?  yes or no?"

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

console.log("Hello world!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

two forward slashes
//

code comments can be used o describe what a certain block of code does.  This can be helpful to myself or my teammates.  

the double slash can also be used to omit the block of code that follows.  This can be useful when debugging/testing code.  It "silences" the code

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?
A variable is something that can change.  Things that vary from day to day?  The temperature outside, the money in someones pocket.
in code we can name things like temperature and then give it a value (like the degrees in farhenheit.  Example in a text editor I can create a variable for temperature by saying
  var (this tells the computer that I am making a variable) and then I want to name it dailyTemp
  so
  var dailyTemp = 72;



6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

Google calendar would use a lot of number variables (keeping track of dates and specific times) and boolean (is it after 3:30 pm?  if true notify user that it is time to begin homework).  Google calendar also uses strings when you add titles and tasks.  What ever you type in to the title or task box is what populates on your calendar.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.
Combining variables and strings together using the + operator.

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?
When a website greets you when you log into your username.  The code probably looks like "Welcome " + userName + "!"

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

What are other data types?

Is an array a data type?

is interpolation or concatenation more often used?
